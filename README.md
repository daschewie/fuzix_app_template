# Fuzix App Templete

This is a simple project for building source code outside of the FUZIX source tree.

## Requirements
- Must have [FUZIX]() checked out with your target (i.e. a2560x) compiling.
- Must add FUZIX_ROOT and USERCPU to your environment variables. I recommend adding the following to `.bashrc`:
  ```
  export FUZIX_ROOT=/path_to_projects/FUZIX
  export USERCPU=68000
  ```
